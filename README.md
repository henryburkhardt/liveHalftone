# liveHalftone
The repository is the opensourcing of my code for a large scale interative display I created using the idea of halftoning (a screen printing technique representing images with a collection of differente sized circles). My algorithm quickly renders a webcam feed into a customizable halftone display.

Recently, I prototyped the project. [Here's how it tunred out.](https://youtu.be/XPbLjMzDpQA)
